Server :
When the a microserver starts, it first initializes the database dedicated to this server. 
After successful initialization, Then the microserver launches the HTTP server handler, which 
manages all HTTP servers and clients associated with this service. 
Finally, the server starts the Kafka handler, responsible for managing all Kafka consumers and producers 
to facilitate data transfer between microservices.

Database:
A dedicated database instance for the microserver that stores and retrieves persistent data 
relevant to the service's domain. It is initialized when the server starts and provides a data layer for business logic operations.

HTTP Handler:
A controller module that initializes and manages HTTP-related components. It routes incoming 
HTTP requests to appropriate handlers and manages HTTP server and client lifecycles.

HTTP Server:
An interface that listens for incoming HTTP requests from external clients or other microservices. 
It processes requests and returns responses based on the serverâ€™s API logic.

HTTP Client:
A component responsible for making outgoing HTTP requests to other services. It is used for 
inter-service communication when data or actions are required from other microservices over HTTP.

Kafka Handler:
A central coordinator for Kafka operations within the microserver. It initializes and manages 
both producers and consumers, ensuring reliable message flow between services.
Kafka Consumer:

A component that subscribes to Kafka topics and listens for incoming messages from other 
microservices. It processes received data and integrates it into the microservice's workflow.

Kafka Producer:
A component responsible for publishing messages to Kafka topics. It sends events or data 
updates to other microservices asynchronously for further processing.
